      <p>Ran a very fast, very sweaty 10 miles with multi-marathon veteran Prachi Gupta. The combination of Spotify's hip hop running playlist and my wearable bluetooth speakers did a great job of keeping us motivated and Central Park parents horrified.</p>

      <p>Contribute to my fundraising efforts and I just might fly to your home and go for a run with you! Did a very sweaty <a href="https://github.com/readingirl/26-at-26/blob/gh-pages/26at26%20images/Screen%20Shot%202016-07-08%20at%209.53.11%20AM.png?raw=true" target="_blank">5.5 miles through Carrboro, N.C.</a> with Adriel Lubarsky this morning, followed by some delicious farm-fresh eggs by Danny, who cooks now.</p>
      <p><strong>July 7, 2016</strong></p>
      <p>A few people have brought <a href="https://aboveaverage.com/bragging-rights-marathon/">this video</a> to my attention. I have no idea why.</p>
         <p><strong>July 2, 2016</strong></p>
    <p>Fundraising is open! Here we go, friends: for less than the cost of a SoulCycle class, you can make a significant difference in a sweet, adorable girl’s life. Oh, and you’ll be helping out kids, too.</p>
    <p><strong>June 11, 2016</strong></p>
    <p>Went for a 7-mile training run with my little cousin Paige, a cross-country superstar. She's used to running through fields of manure in rural Michigan, and even she thought NYC smells bad. </p>
    <p><strong>May 31, 1:48 pm</strong></p> <p>Officially registered for the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon. Promptly took a nap.</p>

 <h3>Say what?</h3>
      <p>Running and me, we go all the way back to middle school, when I joined the cross-country team...as the manager. (All of my friends were on the team, and I didn’t want be left out. But not so much that I'd ever consider sweating.)</p>
    <p>Seriously, if middle school Lindsay knew what she’d commit to doing at age 26, she would be <u>so</u> <u>pissed</u>.
      <p>So, what's changed? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure -- and I'm a little freaked out about what I've gotten myself into. But I can tell you that what you're seeing here is the result of several things I'm hoping to acocmplish this summer:
      <ul style="text-align:left">
        <li>I want to stay fit, and I want to earn a big medal for doing so.</li>&nbsp
        <li>I'm a sucker for good hashtags. #26at26</li>&nbsp
        <li>This crazy world could use more good deeds. And all of the (tax-deductible) money I raise here to guarantee my entry in the race will go to supporting health and fitness programs for students in New York City and across the country.</li>&nbsp
        <li>This fall, I'm beginning a master's program in journalism at NYU. When I'm not running, I've been sitting in front of my computer, trying to learn some basic coding skills by way of building this site. (See how the fundraising bar stays put on the top of the page? That took a month, I kid you not.)</li>&nbsp
        <li>Life transitions can be stressful. Intensive, punishing and utterly exhausting physical exertion helps!</li>

    <h3>I need your help.</h3>
    <p>($$$)</p>
    <p>There are four ways a would-be marathon superstar can earn a spot in the Greatest Race on Earth. She can:</p>
    &nbsp
    <ol style="text-align:left">
      <li><strong>Time-qualify.</strong> For women aged 26, that'd mean being able to run a full marathon in <i>at least</i> 3 hours and 13 minutes. Yeah, okayyyyy then... </li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Do 9+1.</strong> Run 9 races in one year, and volunteer at one more. Again, let's be reasonable.</li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Win the lottery.</strong> Okay, yes, we all know I happen to be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205933708277805&set=a.1127712788994.2020067.1112400072&type=3&theater" target="_blank">very good</a> at that one. But by the time I had the <strike>crazy</strike> <i>inspired</i> idea to run the marathon, it was too late to enter.</li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Raise money for charity.</strong> <i>DING DING DING DING DING</i> </li>
  </ol>
    &nbsp
 <p>Here's where we find out who my friends are...I mean, where you get the opportunity to show how much you care about kids. In order to earn my spot at the base of the Verrezano Bridge come November, I've committed to raising <strong>$2,620</strong> for <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/charities-clubs-and-community/team-for-kids/about-tfk" target="_blank">Team for Kids</a>, an incredibly worthy organization that exposes children around the country to the regular physical activity they need to lead healthy, productive lives. (That I, as a child, received no regular physical activity only serves to underscore how important this mission is.) </p>

  <p>To make it even more worth your while, I'm offering a number of incentives to donors large and small:
 </p>
   <div class="jumbotron">
  <p>
    <strong><big>$2.62</big></p><p></strong> Hug/selfie level. Show up along the route, and I'll take a quick breather for a priceless moment.</p>
  <p> <strong><big>$26.20</big></p><p></strong> Add a song to my <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#secret">secret playlist</kbd>* <em>+ all of the above.</em><div id="secret" class="collapse">
*The secret playlist (copyright: me) is a way for you, dear friend, to run the New York City Marathon with me, without having to actually run. Here’s how it works: for each donation of $26.20, you’ll be able to add one song to the playlist I’ll be running to during the race. I will not know what song you chose until I press play, and I solemnly swear to listen to the entire thing. Yes, that means that if you want me to make my way up the Queesboro bridge at mile 15 to John Cage’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4" target="_blank">4’33”</a> or, if you’re really sadistic, Eiffel 65’s “Blue (Da Ba Dee Da Ba Die), then that’s what I’m going to do. For my sake, please choose kindly.</em>
