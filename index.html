    <p>Fundraising is open! Here we go, friends: for less than the cost of a Soul Cycle class, you can make a significant difference in a sweet, adorable girl’s life. Oh, and you’ll be helping out kids, too.</p>

 <h3>Say what?</h3>
      <p>Running and me, we go all the way back to middle school, when I joined cross-country...as the manager. (All of my friends were on the team, and I didn’t want be left out...But not so much that I'd ever consider lacing up.)</p>
    <p>Seriously, if middle school Lindsay knew what she’d commit to doing at age 26, she would be <u>so</u> <u>pissed</u>.
      <p>So, what's changed? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure -- and I'm a little freaked out about what I've gotten myself into. But I can tell you that what you're seeing here is the result of several things I'm hoping to acocmplish this summer:
      <ul style="text-align:left">
        <li>I want to stay fit, and I want to earn a big medal for doing so.</li>&nbsp
        <li>I like to do good deeds. And all of the money I raise here to guarantee my entry in the race will go to supporting health and fitness programs for students in New York City and across the country.</li>&nbsp
        <li>This fall, I'm beginning a master's program in journalism at NYU. When I'm not running, I've been sitting in front of my computer, trying to learn some basic coding skills by way of building this site. (I promise, it was so, so much harder than it looks.)</li>&nbsp
        <li>Life transitions can be stressful. Intensive, punishing and utterly exhausting physical exertion helps!</li>

    <p>There are four ways a would-be marathonerette can earn a spot in the Greatest Race on Earth. She can:</p>
    &nbsp
    <ol style="text-align:left">
      <li><strong>Time-qualify.</strong> For women aged 26, that'd mean being able to run a full marathon in <i>at least</i> 3 hours and 13 minutes. Yeah, okayyyyy then... </li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Do 9+1.</strong> Run 9 races in one year, and volunteer at one more. Again, let's be reasonable.</li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Win the lottery.</strong> Okay, yes, we all know I happen to be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205933708277805&set=a.1127712788994.2020067.1112400072&type=3&theater">very good</a> at that one. But by the time I had the <strike>crazy</strike> <i>inspired</i> idea to run the marathon, it was too late to enter.</li>&nbsp
      <li><strong>Raise money for charity.</strong> <i>DING DING DING DING DING</i> </li>
  </ol>
    &nbsp
 <p>Here's where we find out who my friends are...I mean, where you get the opportunity to show how much you care about kids. In order to earn my spot at the base of the Verrezano Bridge come November, I've committed to raising <strong>$2,620</strong> for <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/charities-clubs-and-community/team-for-kids/about-tfk">Team for Kids</a>, an incredibly worthy organization that exposes children around the country to the regular physical activity they need to lead healthy, productive lives. (That I, as a child, received no regular physical activity only serves to underscore how important this mission is.) </p>

  <p>To make it even more worth your while, I'm offering a number of incentives to donors large and small:

*The secret playlist (copyright: me) is a TK way for you, dear friend, to run the New York City Marathon with me, without having to actually run. Here’s how it works: for each donation of $26.20, you’ll be able to add one song to the playlist I’ll be running to during the race. I will not know what song you chose until I press play, and I solemnly swear to listen to the entire thing. Yes, that means that if you want me to make my way up the Queesboro bridge at mile 15 to John Cage’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4">4’33”</a> or, if you’re really sadistic, Eiffel 65’s “Blue (Da Ba Dee Da Ba Die), then that’s what I’m going to do.
